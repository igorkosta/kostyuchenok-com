# Incumbents’ Trap

Despite the recent advancements of Neobanks, Incumbents are still the driving banking force of the financial world. Let’s take a look at some number and to make it even more “dramatic” we will see how the neobanks in the UK are doing. 

The UK is one of the markets with the most neobanks per capita. Since not a lot of Neobanks offer proper loans and mortgages we’ll take a look at the retail banking landscape.

In 2026, the ratio between neobanks and traditional banks in the UK retail sector depends entirely on whether you measure usage (having an account) or primary relationship (where your salary goes).

While neobanks have reached a "tipping point" in total users, the "Big Six" incumbents still hold the vast majority of the UK's primary banking volume.
