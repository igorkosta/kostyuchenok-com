Despite the recent advancements of neobanks, incumbents are still the driving banking force of the financial world. Let’s take a look at some numbers — and to make it more “dramatic,” we’ll focus on the UK.

The UK is one of the markets with the most neobanks per capita. Since not many neobanks offer full loans and mortgages, this analysis focuses on the **retail banking landscape**.

In 2026, the ratio between neobanks and traditional banks in the UK retail sector depends entirely on whether you measure **usage** (having an account) or **primary relationship** (where your salary goes).

While neobanks have reached a *tipping point* in total users, the **Big Six incumbents** still hold the vast majority of the UK's primary banking volume.


## 1. The Ratio of "Primary" vs. "Secondary" Accounts

Most UK adults now practice **dual banking**: they keep a traditional bank for perceived security and mortgages, but use a neobank for daily spending and budgeting.

|Metric|Neobanks (Digital-First)|Traditional (Incumbent)|Ratio|
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|
| Active Relationship | ~50% of UK Adults | ~95%+ of UK Adults | 1 : 2 |
| Primary Account | ~6% – 9% | ~91% – 94% | 1 : 15 |
| New Accounts (Last 3 yrs) | ~20% | ~80% | 1 : 4 |


## 2. Market Share Breakdown (2025–2026)

- **Total User Reach:** As of early 2026, approximately **50% of UK adults** use at least one neobank (up from ~16% in 2018).
- **The Primary Shift:** Neobanks increased their share of *primary* accounts from ~1% in 2020 to roughly **9% by 2026**.
- **Deposit Flight:** High-street banks lost approximately **£100 billion** in customer deposits between 2019 and 2025 as users moved funds to neobanks and specialist lenders offering better rates.

## 3. Customer Base Giants

The gap is narrowing in raw user numbers, with the largest neobanks now larger than some mid-tier traditional banks.

- **Lloyds Banking Group:** ~26 million customers (Incumbent leader)
- **Monzo:** ~12 million customers (Neobank leader)
- **Revolut:** ~10 million UK customers (50m+ globally)
- **Starling:** ~4.2 million customers (dominates ~9% of the SME market)

## 4. Key Trends in 2026

- **Generational Divide:** Among Gen Z and Millennials, the ratio is much tighter. For new account openings in the last three years, neobanks captured **1 in 5** new primary relationships.
- **The Profitability Pivot:** Neobanks (Monzo, Revolut, Starling) have moved from “growth at all costs” to sustainable profitability, enabling competition in savings and lending.
- **Trust Gap:** While **83%** of consumers still view traditional banks as more reliable, neobanks consistently win on UX and customer satisfaction, often leading in NPS.

Most neobank customers still use them mainly for **money movement and convenience**, while keeping most funds with incumbents.

## Active vs Primary Relationships in the UK

In the UK, the landscape has shifted from neobanks being “spending cards” to becoming serious competitors. As of early 2026:

- Roughly **1 in 4 (26%)** UK adults has a neobank account
- The majority still rely on incumbents for **salary-in, bills-out** banking

### 1. Market Share: Primary vs Secondary

| Metric | Neobanks (Digital-First) | Incumbents (Traditional) |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Primary Account Share | ~6% | ~94% |
| Active Users (any account) | ~26% | ~95%+ |
| Recent Openings (last 3 yrs) | ~20% | ~80% |

## 2. The Heavyweights (Customer Count)

**Incumbents:**
- Barclays: ~48 million customers
- HSBC: ~39 million customers
- Lloyds Banking Group: ~26 million customers

**Top Neobanks:**
- Revolut: ~10 million UK customers (50m+ globally)
- Monzo: ~12 million UK customers (profitable as of 2025)
- Starling Bank: ~4.2 million customers (~9% of SME market)

## The Structural Problem for Incumbents

The Big Four still dominate UK banking, but they are **slowly losing momentum**. Their customer base is aging, while younger generations — with less generational wealth — are satisfied with neobank offerings.

The **trust gap is closing**, and neobanks increasingly dominate the **SME segment**. Starling, for instance, holds a much higher share of SME accounts than its share of general retail customers.

## Incumbent Strategies (and Failures)

Many incumbents tried launching or acquiring digital banks. Results were mostly poor:

### Failed or Abandoned Initiatives

1. **NatWest / RBS – Bó**
   - Launched 2019, closed after ~6 months due to low traction.

2. **JPMorgan Chase – Finn**
   - Launched ~2018, shut down after ~1 year due to lack of differentiation.

3. **HSBC – Zing**
   - Launched 2024, shut down ~1 year later; tech folded back into HSBC.

4. **Barclays – Pingit**
   - Mobile payments app, later discontinued.

5. **Wells Fargo – Greenhouse**
   - Never fully launched, cancelled before scale.

### Additional Examples

- **Raiffeisen / Zuno (Austria):** Shut down in 2017 due to lack of profitability.
- **BPCE / Fidor (France):** Acquired, later divested due to integration issues.
- **BBVA / Simple (USA):** Acquired, brand shut down in 2021.

## Why Incumbents Struggle

Cultural mismatch is a major factor. The **risk-averse, slow-moving** mindset of incumbents conflicts with the **fast-iteration, product-driven** nature of successful fintechs.

Large migration projects:
- Take years
- Cost huge sums
- Have high failure rates

Many incumbents are trapped by **fragmented legacy systems** and cannot easily leverage their own data — which, in modern finance, *is the new gold*.

## What’s Next?

Incumbents still control most of the capital and **could** turn things around — but they will likely keep losing younger customers.

The more realistic path forward:
- Invest in **growing fintechs**
- Build **modular ecosystems**
- Combine best-in-class services into a **modern financial platform**

Instead of rebuilding everything from scratch, the future likely belongs to **composable banking ecosystems** rather than monolithic legacy institutions.
