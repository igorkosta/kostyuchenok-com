Oman’s banking sector being the smallest in size in CCG Countries has been showing significant growth in the last decade taking the third place after UAE and Saudi Arabia. Banking Sector’s key drivers have been Steady Asset Expansion, robust Credit Growth and the relatively recent introduction of Islamic Banking.

In order to accelerate the growth even more the Central Banking of Oman (CBO) has been actively promoting the Open Banking initiative to fuel the further growth of the Fintech and banking in Oman.

Taking into account the size of the banking market in Oman, one of the few drivers that may bring a significant change is the rapid introduction of the FinTech related services built, among other things, on top of the robust open banking framework.

The major adoption of open banking by the Oman banks will lead to more Streamlined Business Processes, like account verification or payment processing. SMEs will get easier access to loans and credit, the transactions will be carried out at an even faster pace and the cash flow management will improve. Using the standardised open banking framework and cloud-based systems the banks will be able to reduce the overhead costs associated with manual processes. This development will lead to faster service delivery and greater operational agility.

The most important lever though will be the New Revenue Streams and Ecosystems. The banks that will adopt Open Banking first, will lead the race to becoming the Financial Ecosystems. Opening up the regulated and secure access to customer data will lead to the explosion of the new services build by third party providers. Smarter players will use this trend to its own advantage by building the financial marketplaces and integrate the best third party solutions into its own ecosystem.

In order for bank to grow it has to attract new customers and increase its assets.

Attracting new customers

Open banking will streamline customer acquisition by facilitating faster, data-driven onboarding processes. Customers will be able to securely share their data from other institutions reducing the manual labour and the risks associated with the onboarding. Allowing third party providers to build the FinTech services on top of the banking stack will enrich the banking offering and attract new customers. The data analytics leverage will help Omani banks to offer hyper-personalised services to their customers which will inevitably lead to higher customer satisfaction and will foster the competition between different financial institutions. Open banking will also help to onboard customers that are new to formal banking or lack the financial history. It will also help to onboard the customers from other jurisdictions where open banking has already been implemented.

Attracting new assets

Once the banks will be able to analyse customers aggregated assets, they will be in better position to suggest optimised investments strategies or offer savings account with better rates and returns. It will encourage customers to move their “lazy” assets to into wealth management or high-interest products offered within the open banking ecosystem.

Open banking will offer the banks entry into the non-banking platforms like real estate portals or e-commerce sites. Integrating banking services into the daily life of the customers will give them the possibility to capture assets at the point of need.

SMEs are one of the main drivers of economic growth. Open banking can provide powerful tools for Small and Medium Size Enterprises. Streamlined access to accounting software integration and faster credit assessment help businesses manage their cash flow better, encouraging them to deposit and manage their working capital within open banking enabled accounts. Open banking can also help banks create closed loop systems for SMEs that provide them with all the possible tools to manage and credit their business.

Open banking will not only drive the growth of the Omani financial sector by also increase the competition between banks by evening out the playing field.
